1. I asked ChatGPT to generate a small nested json with lists

2. I faced a problem where python could not open the sample.json, ChatGPT pointed out that i could import os.getcwd() to see where Python is currently "standing" which allowed me to change the path to access sample.json.

3. When the issue of flattening the json arrived, chatgpt provided "pseudocode" example which in fact, is functioning code, despite explicitly asking for general logic and steps required. after trying the code, it became clear that it is not fully functional and does not work with json files that have multiple layers, then chatgpt output another code example which also was complete functioning python code that I could implement into my project with minimal changes. It is clear that even when asking to avoid providing a full answer, chatgpt still does it.

I decided to prompt ChatGPT reminding that I am a student and prefer answers in plain English instead of working complete code examples. It provided a good explanation but at this point working with it slowly becomes extraneous load where I spend more time refining its outputs instead of working on the project.

4. ChatGPT talks about using recursion now, since it is a complex technique used in DSA, I decided to ask it for examples. My first prompt will be a vague "Please give me an example". ChatGPT correctly followed my instructions and focused on plain english explanations. 

5. ..and it is gone, chatgpt deleted the conversation and i did not share it beforehand, i will move to another coding project
