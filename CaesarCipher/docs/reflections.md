# Difficulty
    The difficulty was quite low. I had to plan the project to not avoid the stage of planning and strategy. I also had to design the overall logic of application which was successful. AI helped a lot when it actually came to choosing the right approach from the get-go.


# Understanding of solution
    I can totally understand the solution.


# Extraneous and Intrinsic Loads
    There was very little extranenous load, I could ask AI for feedback, corrections and then ask the questions. For example, when it came to using ord() method which was new to me. I managed to understand these concepts while developing the script myself. The only moment when I felt that I delegated some of the cognitive load to AI was when AI provided a full example of how encryption would work with ord(), at this point, I decided to focus on understanding of this concept, since I did not come up with the code myself.


# Confidence in acquired knowledge
    I very confident in the acquired knowledge and understanding of the new concepts.
