# Difficulty
    In theory, even a person that has never coded could have done without really learning much. The whole process can be described in 3 steps: prompt AI with instructions => there is an error => prompt AI with the error/unexepcted behavior and instructions => repeat until the behavior of the code is exptected.


# Understanding of solution
    I can understand the code but considering that AI has create it and it functions as expected, there is no reason to motivation for me to engage with the program or try to modify it. Since I have not created anything myself, I cannot recognize the parts of code that i would definately struggle to recreate. I have no idea of what I can actually fully understand or replicate and I feel no ownership of this code.


# Extraneous and Intrinsic Loads
    There was no cognitive load besides giving the AI instructions and sending it instructions and errors until the script finally worked.


# Confidence in acquired knowledge
    No knowledge acquired.
