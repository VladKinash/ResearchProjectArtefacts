# Difficulty
    I have not used Python for more than a year which made remembering basic syntax difficult. Looking up different methods was a bit more time consumming since google searches is not as efficinet as the AI.

    The problem itself was generally easy and required basic planning and understanding of Python libraries.


# Understanding of solution
    I am totally certain that I understand the solution I created.


# Extraneous and Intrinsic Loads
    There was a lot of extraneous load, most of the time was spent googling specific methods and choosing libraries. There is an inconsistency between different online sources and it was not clear whether I should have had proceeded with Pathlib or Os libraries in Python.

    Many web sources featured complete examples, meaning that I could customize my search request to potentially avoid seeing too much code. For example, I found complete examples of get_dirs() and get_files() so I did not have an opportunity to come up with my own solution.

    Thus, despite not using AI, intrinsic load was reduces and extraneous load was increased.
